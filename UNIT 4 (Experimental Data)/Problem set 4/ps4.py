# To model the change in climate of an area, you will need some data. For this problem set, we will use temperature
# data obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The data, stored in data.csv, contains
# the daily maximum and minimum temperatures observed in 21 U.S. cities from 1961 to 2015. Open the file, and take a
# look at the raw data.
#
# In order to parse the raw data, in ps4.py we have implemented a helper class Climate. You can initialize an
# instance of the Climate class by providing the filename of the raw data. Look over this class and read its docstrings
# to figure out how to get data for the following problems.

# PROBLEM 1- CURVE FITTING

# x and y are two lists corresponding to the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the data samples (or data points);
# for example, if you have N data points, x = [x1 , x2 , ..., xN ] and y = [y1 , y2 , ..., yN ], where x_i and y_i
# are the x and y coordinate of the i-th data points. In this problem set, each x coordinate is an integer and
# corresponds to the year of a sample (e.g., 1997)Í¾ each corresponding y coordinate is a float and represents the
# temperature observation (will be computed in multiple ways) of that year in Celsius. This representation will be
# used throughout the entire problem set.
#
# degs is a list of integers indicating the degree of each regression model that we want to create. For each model,

# This function should return a list of models. A model is the numpy 1d array of the coefficients of the fitting
# polynomial curve. Each returned model should be in the same order as their corresponding integer in degs.

# Example:
#
# print(generate_models([1961, 1962, 1963],[4.4,5.5,6.6],[1, 2]))
# Should print something close to:
#
# [array([ 1.10000000e+00, -2.15270000e+03]), array([ -8.86320195e-14, 1.10000000e+00, -2.15270000e+03])]

# metrics and visualization for a comprehensive evaluation.

# Implement function evaluate_models_on_training. This function takes as input your data samples (x and y) and the list
# of models (which are lists of coefficients obtained from generate_models) that you want to apply to your data.
#
# This function should generate a figure for each model. In this figure, you are to plot your data along with your best
# fit curve, and report on the goodness of the fit with the R^2 value. When you are writing this function try to make
# your graph match the following format:
#
# Plot the data points as individual blue dots
# Plot your model as a red solid line
# Include a title and label your axes
# Your title should include the value of your model and the R^2 degree of this model. Your title could be longer than
# your graph. To fix that you can add "\n", which adds a newline to your string, in your title when you concatenate
# several pieces of information (e.g., title = string_a + "\n" + string_b ).

# raw temperature records and investigate the trend. Run the following code at the bottom ps4.py.
