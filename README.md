# MITx-6.00.2x
Solutions for problem sets for MITx: 6.00.2x (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science) MOOC course

**COURSE OVERVIEW**

This course is aimed at students with some prior programming experience in Python and a rudimentary knowledge of computational complexity. You will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. For example, you will write a program that will simulate a robot vacuum cleaning a room or will model the population dynamics of viruses replicating and drug treatments in a patient's body.

Topics covered include:

Advanced programming in Python 3
Knapsack problem, Graphs and graph optimization
Dynamic programming
Plotting with the pylab package
Random walks
Probability, Distributions
Monte Carlo simulations
Curve fitting
Statistical fallacies
